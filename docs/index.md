# Privacy Policy — FoodVision Tracker

**Effective date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**App name:** FoodVision Tracker  
**Developer:** [Your name / Developer name shown on Google Play]  
**Contact:** [your support email]

This Privacy Policy explains how FoodVision Tracker (“the App”) accesses, uses, and shares data. This policy is provided for transparency and to comply with Google Play requirements.

> **Not legal advice:** This template is not a substitute for advice from a qualified attorney. You are responsible for ensuring this policy matches your actual app behavior.

---

## 1. Summary (Plain English)
- The App lets you **take a meal photo** (camera) or **choose one from your gallery** (photo library) to analyze it.
- Your **meal history** and **profile/health goals** are stored **locally on your device**.
- If you choose to run **AI meal analysis**, the App sends the **selected meal image** (and any text you enter as “context/corrections”) to **OpenAI** using **your own OpenAI API key**.
- The developer does **not** run a custom backend server for storing your meals.
- You can delete meal entries inside the App, and you can delete all local data by uninstalling the App.

## 2. Data We Access or Store

### A) Photos / Camera
**What:** Meal photos you capture with the camera or select from your photo library.  
**Why:** To analyze the meal and to save it in your local meal history.

### B) Meal Data (Local)
**What:** Dish name, ingredients description, nutrition summary, estimated macros, and related notes generated by analysis or entered by you.  
**Where stored:** Locally on your device (app storage).

### C) Profile / Health & Goals (Local)
**What:** Optional data such as name (nickname), age, sex, height, weight, activity level, goals, and nutrition targets.  
**Where stored:** Locally on your device (app storage).  
**Note:** This information can be considered sensitive in some jurisdictions.

### D) API Keys (Local)
**What:** If you choose, you may enter:
- an **OpenAI API key** (for meal photo analysis), and/or
- a **DeepSeek API key** (for AI coach features, if enabled in your build).

**Where stored:** Locally on your device.  
**Important:** You are responsible for keeping your API keys private. The developer does not receive your API keys.

---

## 3. When We Share Data (Third Parties)

### A) OpenAI (AI Meal Analysis)
If you use the AI meal analysis feature, the App sends to OpenAI:
- the meal image you selected/captured, and
- any text you type as context/corrections (for example: “This is chicken, not beef”).

This is needed to return the analysis results to you.  
OpenAI’s handling of API data is governed by OpenAI’s policies and platform documentation. OpenAI states that API data is not used to train models by default (unless you opt in) and that data may be retained for a limited period for abuse monitoring per their documentation.

### B) App Stores / Platform Providers
Google Play and your mobile OS may process certain device/diagnostic information as part of installing, updating, and running apps. This is controlled by those providers and your device settings.

### C) No Ads / No Sale of Data
The developer does not sell your personal data.  
If your build includes ads or analytics in the future, this policy will be updated before release.

## 4. Permissions and How They’re Used
The App may request the following permissions depending on platform/version:

- **Camera:** to take meal photos for analysis.
- **Photo Library / Media:** to pick an existing photo for analysis.
- **Microphone (if requested by the build configuration):** used only if video/audio capture features are enabled in your build. The App’s meal-photo scanning does not require microphone access.
- **Internet:** to send your chosen image/text to AI providers (e.g., OpenAI) and receive results.
- **Storage:** to store images and meal history locally.

You can deny permissions in your device settings, but some features may not work.

## 5. Data Retention & Deletion
- **Local data retention:** Meal history and profile data remain on your device until you delete them in the App or uninstall the App.
- **Third-party retention:** If you use AI analysis, OpenAI may retain request/response data for a limited period per their policies.

**How to delete your data:**
- Delete meal entries inside the App (where supported), and/or
- Uninstall the App to remove locally stored data.

## 6. Security

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---
